## User Story
As a manager to run a shop which sells specific products, I can get the feedback of the customers by using the relative information we have retrieved. Then I can improve my service by designing some novel if most of the feedback is about the style of clothing or holding some promotional activities. So we can get more profit by improving customers' experience.    
  
As a traveler or a tourist, I can use such data that relevant to the restaurant around us to judge whether a specific restaurant is popular, which dishes is the favorite for most people in the menu, what is the average consumption of each restaurant. These information can help us determine which restaurant we should go today.

As a student, I can retrieve the course information and get to know which course I can register this semester is choosed by most students in previous semester. Also through the feedback we gain from other students, I can learn some experience and realize what course is more suitable for me.
